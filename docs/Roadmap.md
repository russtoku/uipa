*Last update: 01/11/2025*  

## Status

| Item | Working Version | Production Version |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Django | 1.11 | 1.9 |
| Python |  3.8 | 2.7 |

Repo: https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/tree/dj_1_11

Froide source merged into UIPA.org in dj_1_11 branch of russtoku's fork of UIPA.org.

### Change Log

- **01/11/2025:** Added site map based on dj_1_11 branch of russtoku fork.
- **12/23/2024:** Fixed some broken things. Removed django-overextends
dependency because the functionality is included in Django 1.9.
- **11/14/2024:** Incorporated froide into uipa project source instead of being
an editable dependency.
- **10/18/2024:** Upgraded to Django 1.11.29 and Python 3.8 (3.7 is the highest
version supported for Django 1.11.29).
- **04/28/2024:** Started.

### Next steps

See the sections below the ROADMAP for more details.

- Finish up **3** (*Upgrade Python to 3.8*) before tackling **8** (*Upgrade Django to
2.0.13*).
- **7** (*Figure out deployment for production*) can be put on hold for a while.


## ROADMAP

  1. Upgrade Django to 1.11.29 (LTS; last version to support Python 2.7)
     with Python 2.7.15.
     - **Completed:** 10/03/2024
        - Can't add public bodies in Admin site.
        - Making a request paritally fails when no elasticsearch or solr.
     - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/
     - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/releases/1.11/ (Release Notes)

     - New in Django 1.11
       - Class-based model indexes
       - Template-based widget rendering
       - Subquery expressions

     - Backwards incompatible changes in Django 1.11
       - GDAL is a required dependency
       - Dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.2 and PostGIS 2.0
       - pytz is a required dependency
       - get_model() and get_models() now raise AppRegistryNotReady if
         they’re called before models of all applications have been loaded.
         If you need the old behavior of get_model(), set the require_ready
         argument to False.

  2. Upgrade Python to 3.7 (highest supported by Django 1.11.17).
     - **Completed:** 10/08/2024
        - Search is working with elasticsearch and django-haystack (supports
        only up to elasticsearch 2.x).
        - No pysolr/Solr.
        - 2to3 refactorings.

  3. Upgrade Python to 3.8
     - **Mostly Completed:** 10/14/2024
     - Does work with Django 1.11.17.
     - Python 3.8 is no longer supported as of 10/07/2024.
     - Add [site
     map](https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/blob/dj_1_11/docs/uipa-site-map.md). **Completed:** 01/11/2025
     - TODO:
       - Create test plan and tests because there are major changes with Django
         2.0.
         - Use `pytest` instead of Django's "manage.py test" which uses
         `unittest`.
     - **WON'T DO**
       - Install GDAL, postgis, and libgeoip for django-floppyforms or not.
         - Can leave things the way they are without GDAL, postgis, and
           libgeoip because they aren't really being used; especially
           floppyforms GEO widgets.
         - If don't need the GIS stuff, see:
           https://github.com/jazzband/django-floppyforms/issues/189#issuecomment-379546682

  4. Incorporate froide as apps instead of a dependency. (Added 11/1/2024)
     - **Completed:** 11/17/2024
     - This makes it easier to make changes to froide by eliminating the need to
       maintain two repos for the UIPA.org website.

  5. Remove django-overextends dependency because Django 1.9 already provides
     the same capabilities. (Added 11/15/2024)
     - **Completed:** 12/22/2024
     - Remove `overextends` from `INSTALLED_APPS` in `froide/settings.py`.
     - Remove `django-overextends` from `requirements.txt`.
     - Change `overextends` to `extends` in templates under `uipa_org`
       directory.

  6. ~~Set up Postfix in a Docker container.~~ Create local test mail server.
     - **Completed:** 12/22/2024
     - **Created test mail server program:** 10/18/2024; see
      [https://github.com/russtoku/test-mail-server](https://github.com/russtoku/test-mail-server)
     - TODO:
       - Send outgoing from UIPA to it.
       - Pull incoming email to UIPA from it.

  7. Figure out deployment for production.
      - What are the pieces?

  8. Upgrade Django to 2.0.13 (needs Python 3.4+).

           a migration while using an older version of Django with SQLite
           3.26 or later (#29182). [Django 2.0.10]
       - default HTTP error handlers (handler404, etc.) are now callables

## What is this about?

The [Public First Law Center](https://www.publicfirstlaw.org/) (formerly Civil
Beat Law Center) wants to get UIPA.org on modern, supported versions of Python
and Django.

The site went live on September 2018 using Python 2.7 and Django 1.9. Both are
have been unsupported for a long time. See the Repositories section below for
the versions of Froide and Froide Theme.

Currently, Code With Aloha is pursuing an
[upgrade](https://github.com/orgs/CodeWithAloha/projects/14) of
[UIPA.org](https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/uipa/wiki) using the latest version
of Froide using Python 3.10 and Django 4.2.

This roadmap is an alternate approach to upgrading UIPA.org to Python 3.10 and
Django 4.2. The newer version of Froide has more feaures that the old
version. The additional features are not likely to be used by UIPA.org
users. Additionally, it is not clear what features users currently use. So,
there is bloat in the software that would be put into production. However, the
critical problem is that few if any will know:
- What's working?
- What isn't working?
- Are there any problems with the parts that no one knows about?

## Strategy for upgrading Django and Python

UIPA.org was built with a modified Froide repository to handle a change in web
page for making FOI requests. Since that time, no upstream changes have been
incorportated. Thus, the forked Froide repository is frozen in time.

This means that we don't really need to keep it separate and can incorporate it
into the UIPA.org repo as included Django apps instead of an editable
dependency.

Another dependency, `django-overextends`, can be eliminated because it's
functionality was included in Django 1.9.

The [Django 1.9 Release
Notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/releases/1.9/) says:
- Django template loaders can now extend templates recursively. (See
[Templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/releases/1.9/#templates)).
- Django template loaders have been updated to allow recursive template
extending. This change necessitated a new template loader API. The old
load_template() and load_template_sources() methods are now deprecated. Details
about the new API can be found in the template loader documentation. (See
[Template loader APIs have
changed](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/releases/1.9/#template-loader-apis-have-changed)).

This is further supported by PR
[#9884](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9884) which adds documentation
about this.
- [@unexceptable's comment on August 12,
  2019](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9884#issuecomment-520636912) says:
    > This was added to django 1.9, but before then many of us got by using:
    > [https://github.com/stephenmcd/django-overextends](https://github.com/stephenmcd/django-overextends)

templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/overriding-templates/).

## Repositories

| UIPA | [https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/uipa](https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/uipa) | master | [https://github.com/okfde/froide-theme](https://github.com/okfde/froide-theme) |
| Froide | [https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/froide](https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/froide) | main | [https://github.com/okfde/froide](https://github.com/okfde/froide) |

UIPA.org was built from a fork of the Froide Theme repo that was renamed to
`uipa`. It's not the only repo. Careful reading of the `README` and the
`requirements.txt` files reveals that Froide is arranged as an editable
dependency (`pip install -r requirements.txt -e . --src=./src`) for UIPA.org.

One of the reasons the Froide repo was forked was because the `FoiRequest`
module was modified to accommodate asking a requester to state why they should
have the fees waived. This was a requirement from the [UIPA request
form](https://oip.hawaii.gov/forms/) provided by the [Office of Information
Practices](https://oip.hawaii.gov/).

The commit history shows that there were other mods made to Froide.

### Repos for this upgrade

## Error loading User model (06/04/2024)

***FIXED!***

### The FIX
This problem is due to the Froide account User model trying to provide a method
to return the SetPasswordForm for the views. The fix is to remove
SetPasswordForm from froide/account/models.py and add it to
froide/account/views.py.

### The problem

When trying to upgrade Django from 1.10.2 (last working UIPA) to 1.11, running
"python manage.py check" fails with an error about the "AUTH_USER_MODEL refers
to model 'account.User' that has not been installed". This is prevent further
progress in upgrading Django and Python.

~~The final conclusion is the old UIPA can't be upgraded so a new UIPA will need
to be created with the current version of Froide.~~

It is possible to change the use of Froide from an installed source dependency
to being a part of the UIPA (Froide Theme) code base. This may make it easier
to mold the newer Froide (Django 4.2) to what UIPA needs by removing froide
apps that may not be useful.

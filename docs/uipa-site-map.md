[New Users Sign Up](#new_users_sign_up))

## Background

The UIPA.org website went live in Sep 2018.
  - https://www.civilbeat.org/2018/09/new-service-helps-public-access-public-records/

The website has not been upgraded to current versions of Python, Django, Linux operating system, and other dependencies.

This site map shows the parts of the website that users can interact with.

| Website | URL |
| ---     | --- |
| UIPA  | http://127.0.0.1:8000/ |
| Admin | http://127.0.0.1:8000/uipa-admin/ |

*NOTE: The above URLs are for a local development server. The production ones
use https://uipa.org/.*

## Logging in

When logging in on the Home page, use an email address and password.

<img src="images/uipa-website-log-in.png" alt="" width=500/>

If logging in on the Admin website, use a username and password.

<img src="images/uipa-admin-website-log-in.png" alt="" width=300/>


## Users

### Roles and Access control

These are the access permissions for the three user roles of UIPA.org.

| User Role     | Search Public Agencies | Search Requests | View a Request | Make a Request | Update a Request | Admin website |
| ---           | ---                    | ---             | ---            | ---            | ---              | ---           |
| anonymous     |  ✓                     |  ✓              |  ✓             |  ✕             |  ✕               |  ✕            |
| regular user  |  ✓                     |  ✓              |  ✓             |  ✓             |  ✓ (originator)  |  ✕            |
| administrator |  ✓                     |  ✓              |  ✓             |  ✓             |  ✕               |  ✓            |

### Users for testing in a development environment

It's useful to have two regular (non-administrative) users to test the access to
requests that they have made versus those that are not theirs.

These users are created when the seed data is loaded.

| Role         | Email Address  | Username  | Full Name        |
| ---          | ---            | ---       | ---              |
| Regular user | lani@uipa.org  | lani      | Lani Aloha       |
| Regular user | joe@uipa.org   | joe       | Joe Aloha        |
| Admin user   | admin@uipa.org | admin     | Adam Ministrator |

### OUT OF SCOPE

In the Admin website, users can be granted "staff" privileges to use part of or
all of the Admin website. This feature is not being investigated for this
document.

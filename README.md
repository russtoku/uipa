# UIPA.org - Uniform Information Practices Act portal

This is a basic Django project with a theme app that plugs into
[Froide](https://github.com/stefanw/froide). It's based on the [Froide Base
Theme](https://github.com/okfde/froide-theme).

## Get started easily


In a Python virtualenv, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt -e . --src=./src
    python manage.py syncdb  --noinput
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    python manage.py loaddata uipa_org/fixtures/*
    python manage.py runserver

At this point, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser and you should see
the home page for uipa.org.

Be sure to remember the password for the admin user you create so that you can
log on to the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/uipa-admin/. You can
create or modify flatpages there.

[Here is a complete guide of how to set this up on
Heroku.](http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/herokudeployment/)


## Froide documentation

http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/gettingstarted/

For details about working with Froide Themes see [Theming
Froide](http://froide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/theming/).


## Creating page content for the About, Help, Terms of Use, and Privacy Statement links

Django Flat Pages are used to create these pages. They are "flat" HTML content
stored in the database. For details, see [The flatpages
app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/1.9/ref/contrib/flatpages/)
documentation.

To create these pages initially, we:

* Create the pages using the Django administration interface at
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/uipa-admin/. Click on the *Flat pages* link.
* Dump the database in JSON format (see below).
* Edit the dump file, `<db-dump>.json`.
* Copy the section of JSON data for the model, `flatpages.flatpage` (see
  below).
* Put the JSON data in a file under the uipa_org/fixtures directory named
  `flatpages.flatpage.json`.


### Loading the page data

Once the page data files have been created under the fixtures directory, they
can be loaded whenever a new instance of uipa.org is created. This is done by
loading the page data files using this command:

```
python manage.py loaddata <page>
```
where `<page>` is the name of the page data file without the `.json`
extension. Multiple pages can be loaded at the same time.


### Dumping the database

Dumping the database in JSON format is done using the command:

```
python manage.py dumpdata | python -m json.tool > db-dump.json
```


### Page data in JSON format

Here's an example of the page data in JSON format for the About page in the
fixtures/about-page.json:

```

        "fields": {
            "content": "<p>UIPA.org is the place where you can request information from your State of Hawaii government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UIPA stands for Uniform Information Practices Act and is the law covered by HRS Chapter 92F.
